# 1. Vectors
##############################################################################
# We start by creating a sequence of  numbers. 
# Here is a very simple sequence
integers <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
integers

# there is a more compact way of creating a sequence like this:
integers <- 1:100
integers

# or
integers <- seq(1,100, 1)
integers

# 2. Key Statistics
##############################################################################
# so now we have a set of numbers. We can think of these numbers as
# a "vector", a "variable", or a "draw from a distribution"
# Now for some key features of this vector.

# THe size of the vector
length(integers)

# Lets store this:
n <- length(integers)

# The sum of the vector
sum(integers)

# The mean
mean(integers)

# To caulcate the mean manually:
sum(integers)/length(integers)

# The median
median(integers, na.rm=FALSE)

# The variance
var(integers)

# To calculate the variance manually:
mean((integers-mean(integers))^2)*(n/(n-1))

# The standard deviation
sd(integers)

# The square of the standard deviation
sd(integers)^2

# The biggest number
max(integers)

# THe smallest  number
min(integers)

# The 15th percentile (similar for any percentile)
quantile(integers, .15)

# You can look at many of these statistics  at once
summary(integers)

describe(integers)

# you can graph this vector in many ways
# a histogram
hist(integers)

# a box plot
boxplot(integers)

# 3. Random samples
##############################################################################
# Now lets generate random samples of numbers and look at their properties
# Lets start simple and say we have a vector with just two numbers, 0 and 1
x <- 0:1

# We can sample one number from this vector like this
sample(x,1)
# and again
sample(x,1)
# and again
sample(x,1)

# If we did this many many times we would build up a new vector 
# where each number in the vector is a coin flip. Our vector would then 
# be a draw from a Bernoulli distribution.

# Lets do a 10 draws from (0,1) and put them into a new vector called "draws"
# we first create a placeholder vector:
draws<-NA
# we then sample 10 times and each time put the result into position i in the new vector
for(i in 1:10) draws[i]<- sample(x,1)
# Lets look at the variable
draws
# The new variable we have made should have a mean close to .5 and a standard deviation close to .5. 
mean(draws)
sd(draws)
# The histogram of this variable is like a bar chart:
hist(draws)
# The number of 1's in our draw is just the sum of all elements in the vector draws
sum(draws)

# TIP: above we used a "loop" to create the new variable but often this can be done 
# much more compactly using the sapply function
# in this case this would be done in one line rather than two lines like this

sapply(1:10, function(i) sample(x,1))

# TIP 2: When we use sample we can also speed things up by asking for many draws at once, assuming each draw is done "with replcaement"
sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE)

# Say now we did this whole operation 10 times
# we first create a new  vector
draws2<-NA
# we then do the previous operation 10 times 
for(i in 1:10) draws2[i]<- {sum(sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE))}

# Or more compactly
draws2<-sapply(1:10, function(i)  {sum(sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE))})
# draws2 is a "Binomial" distribution. Each number in the vector is the number of 
# heads from 10 coin tosses. Lets look at it.
draws2
# And lets graph the result
hist(draws2)
# You should see a few 5s and probably some 4s and 6s. Maybe some other numbers also.
# Compare the two graphs
# To get a good feel for the distribution though we should do this more than 10 times. 
# Lets do it 1000 times.

draws2<-sapply(1:1000, function(i)  {sum(sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE))})

# And lets graph the result
hist(draws2)
# Again compare this to the graph you had before, what do you see?
# This should now be a nice symmetric distribution. Its a "Binomial" distribution.

# There are existing R function to generate many types of distribution 
# For example you can get 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution like this:
runif(10)

# Or more generally, for values between 2 and 4 
runif(10, min = 2, max = 4)

# If you wanted to draw from a discrete uniform distribution you could do it like this
floor(runif(10, 1, 11))
# where floor means we are rounding off to the lower interger 
# the second value is the low end of the range and the third value the upper end

# You can take 10 draws from a standard normal distribution like this:
rnorm(10)
# Or more generally, with mean = 5 and sd = 3 
rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 3)

# We can take samples from a Binomial distribution like this
rbinom(10, 5, .5)
rbinom(10, 1000, .5)
# Here the first number is the number of draws, the second number is the number of
# Bernouli trials in each draw and the third number is the underlying probability

# So instead of 
# sapply(1:1000, function(i)  sum({sapply(1:10, function(j) sample(c(0:1),1))}))
# We could have just done
# rbinom(1000, 10, .5)

# We can also take our Bernoulli trials like this
sample(0:1, 100, replace=TRUE)

# or like this
rbinom(100, 1, .5)

# or like this
(runif(100)<.5)*1

# 4. Samples of samples and the Central Limit THeorem
##############################################################################

# Consider again the graph of the Binomial distribution we generated

hist(rbinom(1000, 10, .5))

# You might notice that this looks a bit like a normal distribution. 
# There is a reason for that:
# The distribution of the mean of random samples tends towards a Normal distribution as the 
# size of the samples gets large. That's the central limit theorem. 
# The Binomial distribution is the distribution of sums (rather than means) of 
# draws from a Bernoulli distribution. So it behaves the same way.
# A small change in our code illustrates the Central Limit Theorem nicely:

# We made as few changes. Can you see what and why?
hist(rbinom(100000, 10000, .5)/10000, breaks = 50)

# It's amazing that you can generate a normal distribution like this using 
# only a set of coin flips. To make this more explicit
# Create a big matrix of 0s and 1s
flips = matrix(sample(0:1, 10000000, replace=TRUE), 10000,1000)

# and graph the means of each row
hist(apply(flips, 1, mean), breaks = 50)

```
