## Setup to use the bibliography file

To use the bibliography file you'll need to initialize and update the submodules associated with this repository. You may be able to do this nicely using a GUI. At the command line you'd do the following:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## File Formats

Some files are in [Rmarkdown (.Rmd)](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) or markdown (.md) formats. You can edit them using any plain text editor. For example, RStudio has a built in text editor. [more text editor suggestions]

If you want to turn Rmarkdown files into pdf files, you will probably want to install latex (for example, for Mac try <https://tug.org/mactex/> on Windows <http://miktex.org/> or <https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html>, for Linux <https://www.tug.org/texlive/> ).
